Below is a **conceptual model and requirements specification** for a street-level image capture and visualization system comparable to Google Street View.
Assumptions are stated explicitly where needed. The focus is on **technical feasibility, scalability, and user utility**.

## 1. System Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

The system captures, processes, stores, and serves **street-level panoramic imagery** aligned to geographic coordinates, enabling users to visually explore real-world locations through an interactive map-based interface.

### Scope

Included:

* Mobile image capture from vehicles and/or handheld devices
* Geospatial processing and image stitching
* Large-scale storage and retrieval of panoramic imagery
* Public-facing visualization via web and API interfaces
* Periodic updates to reflect environmental changes

Excluded:

* Indoor mapping
* Real-time video streaming
* Autonomous navigation or driving functionality
* Editorial or interpretive content beyond visual data

## 2. Primary Stakeholders and Roles

### 2.1 System Owner / Operator

* Defines coverage areas and update cadence
* Operates capture infrastructure
* Maintains backend systems and service availability

### 2.2 Data Collection Operators

* Deploy and maintain capture hardware
* Execute planned capture routes
* Monitor capture quality and system health

### 2.3 End Users (Public or Licensed)

* View street-level imagery
* Navigate spatially and temporally through imagery
* Integrate imagery into external applications (via APIs)

### 2.4 Platform Integrators / Developers

* Consume APIs for embedding or analysis
* Build derivative services using imagery and metadata

### 2.5 Regulatory or Compliance Stakeholders

* Impose constraints on data collection, retention, or access
* Typically external to system operation but influence requirements

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Image Capture

* Capture high-resolution images at fixed spatial intervals along traversed routes
* Support 360° panoramic or multi-directional image acquisition
* Record precise GPS coordinates, orientation, timestamp, and sensor metadata

### 3.2 Image Processing

* Stitch raw images into panoramic views
* Perform geometric correction and alignment
* Associate each panorama with a spatial graph (road network or path)

### 3.3 Data Storage and Indexing

* Store raw and processed imagery
* Index imagery by:

  * Geographic coordinates
  * Capture time
  * Road segment or spatial node

### 3.4 Visualization and Navigation

* Enable map-based navigation to imagery locations
* Support smooth transitions between adjacent panoramas
* Allow rotation, zoom, and perspective control within a panorama

### 3.5 Temporal Access

* Support multiple imagery versions for the same location
* Allow users to select imagery by capture date (if available)

### 3.6 API Access

* Provide programmatic access to:

  * Panorama metadata
  * Image tiles
  * Spatial relationships
* Enforce rate limits and access controls

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Scalability

* Support ingestion of millions of images per day
* Horizontally scalable storage and processing pipelines
* Efficient global content delivery via caching/CDN

### 4.2 Performance

* Initial panorama load within acceptable latency (e.g., <2 seconds on broadband)
* Smooth navigation between adjacent panoramas

### 4.3 Availability and Reliability

* High service uptime (e.g., ≥99.9%)
* Redundant storage and processing infrastructure

### 4.4 Data Quality

* Minimum resolution and clarity thresholds
* Accurate geospatial alignment within defined tolerances

### 4.5 Security

* Secure access to internal systems
* Protect APIs from misuse
* Prevent unauthorized modification of imagery or metadata

### 4.6 Maintainability

* Modular processing pipeline
* Ability to reprocess imagery as algorithms improve

## 5. Key Data Entities and Relationships

### 5.1 Entities

**CaptureSession**

* SessionID
* Vehicle/device ID
* Start/end time
* Operator metadata

**RawImage**

* ImageID
* CaptureSessionID
* Timestamp
* Camera orientation
* GPS coordinates

**Panorama**

* PanoramaID
* Geographic location
* Capture timestamp
* Linked RawImages
* Resolution and projection metadata

**SpatialNode**

* NodeID
* Coordinates
* Connected nodes (graph edges)

**RoadSegment / Path**

* SegmentID
* Geometry
* Associated SpatialNodes

**UserRequest**

* RequestID
* Location query
* Timestamp
* Access channel (web/API)

### 5.2 Relationships

* CaptureSession → RawImages (1-to-many)
* RawImages → Panorama (many-to-1)
* Panorama → SpatialNode (many-to-1)
* SpatialNodes → RoadSegments (many-to-many)
* UserRequests → Panoramas (many-to-many, dynamic)

## 6. Implicit Assumptions

### 6.1 Data Collection

* Image capture occurs from publicly accessible spaces
* GPS and orientation sensors provide sufficient accuracy for alignment
* Capture routes are planned and repeatable

### 6.2 Users

* Users primarily seek visual context, not authoritative measurement
* Most users access imagery via map-based navigation rather than search alone
* Network connectivity is available during use

### 6.3 Acceptable Use

* Imagery is consumed for visualization, navigation, or contextual awareness
* Automated bulk extraction is limited to authorized API access
* Content accuracy is best-effort and not guaranteed to be current

### 6.4 Regulatory Constraints

* The system must support region-specific controls (e.g., disabling capture or display in certain areas) where legally required
* Compliance is handled through configuration rather than core architectural changes

---

## 7. Conceptual Summary

The system is a **large-scale geospatial imaging platform** composed of:

* Distributed capture mechanisms
* High-throughput processing pipelines
* Spatially indexed data stores
* Interactive visualization and API delivery layers

Its value derives from **spatial continuity, coverage density, and ease of navigation**, rather than real-time accuracy or semantic interpretation.
